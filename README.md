# GPS-Data-Analysis

Modern fittness tracking apps such as Strava and Garmin Connect make extensive use of sensor data to
provide insights into a user's exercise program. This project will concentrate on the analysis of GPS data
collected during a mountain bike ride in the Stockrington State Conservation Area.
The GPS track log is presented in a csv file containing timestamps, latitude, longitude, and elevation
columns recorded at 1 second intervals.
In this project you will analyse this GPS data to create some common analysis metrics provided by fitness
tracking services. Some effort will also be made to interpolate missing data in places where the GPS signal
was lost.
